Implementation of SVM classifier in varied ways including:
- SVM from scratch (without packages usage) with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update rule
- Comparing various kernels and hyperparameters to fit the best model to a given problem
- One vs Others - using binary SVM classifier to cluster multi-class data
